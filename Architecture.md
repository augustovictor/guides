- Who is a software architect?
    - Technical expert
    - Good communicator and listener
    - Collaborator
    - Workflow begins with an idea that must be heard and understood. Then Synthesized through communication and collaboration across the organization. And finally trascripted to an architecture along with the stakeholders, based on their needs and goals.

        - Choose between purchasing or constructing a solution. It is the architect responsability to guide the enterprise on which path to follow;
        - Design a solution that solves business problem
            - Goals:
                - Solve the problem;
                - Understanding entire problem;
                - Creating technical solution;
            - This design should be technically and organizationally feasible;
                - Goals:
                    - Communicating the solution
                    - Technical and Non-technical stakeholders
                - Before drawing any solution, understand organizational business and technical tolerances;
                - Take into account when designing a solution:
                    - Team experience
                    - Project duration
                    - Cost

        - Evaluate Architecture
            - Evaluate own architecture and peers architecture
            - Evaluation aspects:
                - How well the solution solves the problem;
                - Address quality attributes;
                - How it meets the projects and organization goals;
        
    - Non-Technical
        - Identify how a solution will achieve its business goals. This can be identified by:
            - Project scope and functional requirements;
            - Discussion with business stakeholders;
            - Present a high level architecture
                - This is where the architect interpretation of the business goals is presented;
            - Divide project into subsystems
                - Smaller workable chunks
                - Smaller teams working concurrently
- Why does an organization need software architects?
    - To mitigate risk
    - Most common reasons project fails:
        - Does not achieve business goals;
        - Takes too long;
        - Costs too much;
    - Architects bring:
        - Vision, leadership, structure and experience
    - Project estimates and duration
        - Feasibility is based on top down estimates;
        - Duration is based on bottom up estimates;
    - Define the Need vs. Want with business team;
    - Reduce time and cost
        - The architect should identify complex components and along with the business decide whether to keep or eliminate them;
        - More developers does not always help
    
### Project phases
- Initiation
    - First thing the architect/architects should do is to outline a viable solution;
        - Identify the most complex pieces of the solution;
            - Generally the most complex pieces are the ones that will interact with third party systems;
        - Identify portions that will most greatly impact timeline and cost (Architecturally significant portions of the project);
    - Project Sizing
        - Provide a high level cost and resource estimates so the business can decide whether the project is viable;
        - This is not an actuall estimation, but a general connotation that does not imply commitment;
        - Create bucket sizes
            - Small: <5 people / <6 months
            - Medium: 5-10 people / 3 to 12 months
            - Large: 25+ / 6-12+ months
    - Know the stakeholders
        - Organization leaders
        - Enterprise architects
        - Project managers
        - Business users
        - Understand their needs and goals
    - Know what questions to ask
    - Develop and maintain strong feedback loops
    - Technical vision document
        - It describes the overall plan/vision for the solution
            - It outlines the core requirements in a very high level, based on the key features;
            - Quality attributes, constraints, goals;
        
- Assembling the team
    - Architects, Senior Developers and Business domain experts;
    - Purposes:
        - Create a feedback loop of trusted domain and tech experts;
    - Let the team participate to the design process;
        
- Requirements
    - Functional requirements (What the system shall do (Not how to implement))
        - Architect plays a supportive role
        - A good functional requirement describes:
            - Input
            - Behavior
            - Output
    - Non-functional requirements (What the system shall be)
        - Identify these requirements first
        - Architect plays a more active role
        - This kind of requirements are the ones that impact the architecture;
        - Some of the non-functional requirements are the cross cutting concerns and quality attributes;
        - Examples of non-functional requirements (Quality attributes list):
            - Accessibility
            - Availability
            - Configurability
            - Extensibility
            - Performance
            - Maintainability
            - Scalability
            - Security
            - Supportability
            - Testability
            - Usability
        - Questions to ask to find answers on non-functional requirements:
            - How many users are expexted to use the system initially?
            - What will this grow to in the future?
            - What will the business impact be if the system is unavailable?
        - Identify constraints:
            - Time
            - Resource
            - Budget
            - Team skills
            - Deployed infrastructure
            - Standards
                - Architectural
                - Technology
                - Coding
- Design
    - Here is when the architect creates a design that meets the needs of the business;
    - It is the process that focus on understanding and defining structures taht make up the solution. Whereas Documentation is the process of communicating the solution externally to an audience;
    - There will be mistakes and the key is making them less expensive to change. It is an iterative process;
    - Identify the portions of the solution that are most likely to change and design a solution to mitigate these risks;
        - Risky portions often occur at boundaries;
        - It is a good idea to develop a high level design with a small group of people and a more detailed one with more experienced developers;
        - Things to keep in mind when selecting the design team:
            - This is not a place for junior developers
        - Design sessions workflow:
            - Begin with brainstorming;
            - The team does not have to understand every little aspect of the problem, but the whole problem that is being solved;
            - Create Views that communicate structures to an audience
                - Views are representations of the design to a particular audience.
                    - Some views target business;
                    - Some views target technical;
                    - Some views target both;
                - Each view represents a single perspective of the solution to THAT audience;
                    - In this case views are windows into your design;
                    - No single viewpoint represents the entire solution;
    
- Construction
    - The architect organize the project into logical segments;
    - The architect must train the team to get them up to speed;
    - Stay one step ahead of development effort;
    - Review functional requirements to make sure assumptions made in the beginning of the project still hold true (Design validation);
        - If there will be any change the architect must provide technical direction to the team;
    - The architect should decide with the team:
        - Unit testing requirements;
        - Change management practices;
        - Coding standards;
        - Source code pository;
    - Code review should be an integrap part of the process;
    
    
- Testing
- Implementation

### The three big concerns:
- Function;
- Separatioon of components;
- Data management;

### Programming Paradigms
- Structure Programming: Imposes discipline on direct transfer of control;
    - Forces us to recursively decompose a program into a set of small provable functions;
- Oriented Programming: Imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control;
    - Allows us to use the plugin architecture. In which modules that contain high-level policies are independent of modules that contain low-level details. The low-level details are relegated to plugin modules that can be deployed and developed independently from other modules;
- Functional Programming: Imposes discipline upon assignment;
    - Race conditions, deadlock conditions and concurrent update problems are due to mutable variables.
    - In order to avoid these problems we should immutability but for that we need to make some compromises:
        - Segregation of mutability
            - Separate Immutable Components (pure functional way) from Mutable Components (not purely functional).
            - Since mutating state exposes these components to concurrency problems, it is commont practice to use some kind of transactional memory to protect mutable variables from concurrent updates and race conditions.
            - Push as much processing as possible into immutable components.

Any program can be constructed just from these three structures:
- Sequence;
- Selection;
- Iteration;
- Indirection;

'We prove we are correct by failing to prove incorrectness, despite our best efforts.'

## Expectations of a software architect
- Analyze technology, industry, and market trends and keep current with those latest trends;
- ( Core thing ) Analyze the current technology environment and recommend solutions for improvement;
- Ensure compliance with the architecture
    - Create checkboxes and stuff so people know what they have to comply with;
- Have exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, platforms, and environments;
- Possess exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation, and negotiation;
- Define the architecture and design principles to guide technology decisions for the enterprise;
- Understand the political climate of the enterprise and be able to navigate the politics;

## Architecture aspects
- Leadership and communication
- Techinal knowledge
- Business domain knowledge
- Methodology and strategy

## Is X an architectural question?
- To find the answer we have to consider Type X Implementation

## Antipattern
- Choose technology first and then build the architecture around it;
